        desc: "Re-structuring backbone networks is complex and expensive. Network operatorsâ€™ needs to carry out careful network planning manually, designing networks topologies while keeping room for network upgrade in future. However, manual network planning brings with it tedious tasks of files maintenance. Our application provides network operators the ability to model networks from scratch or upgrade existing networks by trying out different network physical topologies that suits operator needs. By easily restructuring the network design virtually, network operators can test dynamic traffic patterns and draw solutions that will provide optimal utilization of network elements. Our application takes physical topology, traffic matrix, network parameters and some other network constraints as input. After providing input, the application performs routing and wavelength or light channel assignment algorithm to find optimal solution for given network state, providing results for used wavelengths or light channel and number of traffic request served along with our application computes position of network elements like amplifiers dynamically to uphold quality of signal. Lastly, graphical solution over map and charts provides high overview of network capacity, capabilities and agility to improve over time to serve growing network demands.",

        desc: "Open Networking has brought a lot of possibilities and opportunities for automated configuration and management of the networking and computing equipment/devices. The concepts are now grown way beyond configuration and management with the introduction of network programmability and Software Defined Networking (SDN). The manual configuration and management of these devices were error prone and cumbersome. The Open Networking Engine (ONE) is an API engine which will provide a user friendly API for configuration, management, operation and monitoring of the network devices. Initially a set of NETCONF/RESTCONF & YANG based APIs will be written for ONOS SDN controller in an optical networking environment. During the process YANG model of different devices will be used and may be produced if required. The work can be extended in future to add support for other transport protocols e.g gNMI and gNOI and for different SDN controllers in different networking environments.",
